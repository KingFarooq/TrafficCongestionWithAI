# AI-Powered Traffic Optimization System - fmanwar3710@gmail.com

## 📌 Overview
This project is a comprehensive AI-powered traffic optimization system developed as a year-long research project for school. The system analyzes road images, detects traffic markings and elements, assesses congestion levels, and recommends optimal solutions considering various constraints and restrictions.

Key Features:
- Computer vision model to detect 20+ traffic elements (arrows, lines, markings)
- Comprehensive traffic analysis considering multiple factors
- Solution recommendation engine with 40+ possible improvements
- Visualization of proposed modifications
- Customizable restrictions system
