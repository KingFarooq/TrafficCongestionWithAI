🚦 AI-Powered Traffic Congestion Analysis & Optimization

A year-long research project using computer vision and urban planning principles to reduce traffic congestion.

📌 Key Features

✅ 20+ Traffic Element Detection (Arrows, lines, crosswalks, etc.)
✅ Congestion Scoring Algorithm (Based on road capacity, speed, and markings)
✅ 40+ Customizable Restrictions (No construction zones, policy limits, etc.)
✅ Solution Recommender (Prioritizes fixes by cost, impact, and safety)
✅ Visualization Engine (Shows proposed road modifications)
🛠️ Technical Stack
Component	Technology Used
